# 311StreamgraphsKCMO
Streamgraphs of 311Data in R

These scripts work in R to create two streamgraphs from Kansas City, Missouri's 311 data. This project is forked from code written by @technickle. The original code is available at https://gist.github.com/technickle/67c3cebb687a3b370d0ea3435012b941. 

This code was adapted by @EricRoche in the KCMO City Manager's Office of Performance Managemetn to use KCMO 311 data. The 311 data is available in updated, raw form here. https://data.kcmo.org/311/311-Call-Center-Service-Requests/7at3-sxhp. 

@buzwells used the data from the "Monday" script to generate a D3 visual for an average Monday in KCMO. You can find his code for that visualization here: https://github.com/buzwells/d3-scratchpad.
